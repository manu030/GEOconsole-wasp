# Persona Mapping + Artifact Creation for GEO

---

## 🎯 Why Persona Mapping Matters in GEO

> “Prompts aren’t typed by keywords. They’re typed by people.”
> 

Every prompt starts with a human — and that human has a **goal**.

To win in LLM visibility, you need to reverse-engineer:

- **Who is asking the question**
- **What stage of their journey they’re in**
- **What kind of answer they’re looking for**

This is **persona mapping for prompts** — not just marketing personas, but **prompt-stage archetypes**.

## 👥 The 3 LLM Persona Types

Based on the GrowthX framework, most prompts fall into one of these categories:

---

### 1. **The Explorer**

Curious, early-stage, discovering concepts.

**Prompt style:**

- “What is [X]?”
- “Why does [Y] matter in 2025?”

**Content match:**

- Definitions
- Lists
- High-level frameworks
- Concept explainers

---

### 2. **The Comparator**

Looking for side-by-side breakdowns.

**Prompt style:**

- “Best [X] tools for [Y]”
- “Alternatives to [Z]”
- “Compare [A] vs [B]”

**Content match:**

- Tables
- Pros/cons
- Stat blocks
- Mini-matrix

---

### 3. **The Executor**

Ready to take action, wants tactical info.

**Prompt style:**

- “How to do [X] with [Y]”
- “Prompt for writing [Z]”
- “Checklist for [X] strategy”

**Content match:**

- Step-by-step guides
- Templates
- Prompts
- Embedded code/snippets

## 🔨 What Are Artifacts?

> “Artifacts are the assets LLMs can lift into their responses.”
> 

An **artifact** is a structured content block **designed for reuse** in LLM answers.

They are:

- Modular
- Visually and semantically clear
- Aligned with a single prompt intent
- Standalone when lifted out of the page

---

## 🧱 Artifact Examples That Get Cited

| Prompt Intent | Ideal Artifact |
| --- | --- |
| “What is GEO in SEO?” | Definition block or framework |
| “Top AI SEO tools” | Ranked list with logos and links |
| “Prompt to audit LLM content” | Copy-paste prompt template |
| “Compare Jasper vs Copy.ai” | Feature comparison table |
| “Checklist for SEO audit” | Bullet checklist in collapsible section |

These are not “sections of a blog.”

They are **visibility assets** — atomic blocks that get **summarized, cited, or directly reused** by ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

## ✏️ Tips for Effective Artifact Creation

- **1 artifact per prompt**
    
    Don’t mix too many intent types in one page
    
- **Label them clearly**
    
    Use headings like “Step-by-Step Guide,” “Prompt Template,” or “Comparison Table”
    
- **Minimize fluff**
    
    Keep them tight, readable, and copy-ready
    
- **Use bold, bullets, and spacing**
    
    Structure matters more than prose
    
- **Repeat framing and keywords**
    
    Helps with contextual and semantic match

## 🧩 Bringing It Together

> “Prompts don’t match blog titles. They match usable content chunks.”
> 

Your job in GEO is to **connect prompt → persona → artifact**.

| Prompt | Persona | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “What is generative SEO?” | Explorer | Concept explainer |
| “Best tools like Surfer SEO” | Comparator | Tool listicle |
| “LLM SEO checklist” | Executor | Downloadable checklist |

---

## TL;DR

- GEO starts with **prompt-stage thinking**, not just buyer journey
- Map prompts to **persona intent** to guide structure
- Build **artifacts** — not essays — that LLMs can easily cite
- Use 1 prompt = 1 artifact logic for maximum liftability
